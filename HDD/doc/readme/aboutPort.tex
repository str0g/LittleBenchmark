There are few important differences between Linux and windows:\\
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
  & Linux & Windows & \\ \hline
char size & 1 & 1 & byte\\ \hline
wchar_t size & 2 & 4 & byte\\ \hline
string size & 8 & 4 & byte\\ \hline
wstring size & 8 & 8 & byte\\ \hline
\end{tabular}\\
Linux provides by default wide characters and utf-8 support which windows does not.
\begin{itemize}
\item [\textbf{Windows:}]Conversion from string.find to int64 have to be done with conversion to int in order to not lose -1 if occurred...
\item [\textbf{Windows:}]Console closed by x had to be handled in dedicated way.
\item [\textbf{Windows:}]New line character had to be replaced with enter in configuration module.
\item [\textbf{Windows:}]Lack of linkable libcryptopp.
\item [\textbf{Windows:}]mode\_t variables are unused but present and redefined as int.
\end{itemize}
