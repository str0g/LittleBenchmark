\item [\bf{Memory leak}] 32 records lost when running with -M\\ Solution unknown: Lost is in static allocated memory.
\item [\bf{Strange Log Output}] Example: \begin{verbatim}
Min:1e+09s
Max:[Failed to measure: time difference to small]
Avg:-nans
\end{verbatim} Memory allocation failed or your hard drive for given data is immeasurable fast :-)

\item [{\bf Linux}] Memory leak caused by bug in {\itshape pwd.h} library
\marginpar{12 records in worst case scenario can take max 8192 bytes, libc-freeres won't do the job so please apply solution}
\begin{verbatim}
#include <pwd.h> /*12 records lost*/
struct passwd *pw;
\end{verbatim}
{\bf Solution:} line 7-9 word ``{\itshape compat}'' have to be replaced with ``{\itshape files}''
\begin{verbatim}
lukasz@lukasz-compal:~$ cat -n /etc/nsswitch.conf 
     1	# /etc/nsswitch.conf
     2	#
     3	# Example configuration of GNU Name Service Switch functionality.
     4	# If you have the `glibc-doc-reference' and `info' packages installed, try:
     5	# `info libc "Name Service Switch"' for information about this file.
