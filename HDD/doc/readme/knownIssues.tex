\item [\bf{Memory leak}] 32 records lost when running with -M\\ Solution unknown: Lost occurred in memory allocated by linked libraries.
\item [\bf{Strange Log Output}] Example: \begin{verbatim}
Min:1e+09s
Max:[Failed to measure: time difference to small]
Avg:-nans
\end{verbatim} Memory allocation failed or your hard driver is immeasurable fast for given data :-)

\item [{\bf Linux}] Memory leak caused by bug in {\itshape pwd.h} library\\
12 records in worst case scenario can take max 49152 bytes, libc-freeres won't do the job so please apply solution if \href{http://valgrind.org/}{\underline{Valgrind}}  detect a leak.
\begin{verbatim}
#include <pwd.h> /*12 records lost*/
struct passwd *pw;
\end{verbatim}
{\bf Solution:} Word ``{\itshape compat}'' have to be replaced with ``{\itshape files}''
\begin{verbatim}
# sed -i 's/compat/file/g' /etc/nsswitch.conf
\end{verbatim}
