\item [\textbf{Option parser}] Before every probe and directory have to be input argument marker.\\Exmaple -x 1k -x 2m -x3g -w path1 -w path2\ldots (Change forced for Windows compatibility)
\item [\textbf{Out File Data buffer}] Is created at thread start and expanding to new data sizes\\ Buffer is being freed after last test.
\item [\textbf{Memory hungry} ] Benchmark was design in way to simulate multiple file reading situations.\\
This means that data is being cached in list and wait for verification. After verification memory is going to be freed.
